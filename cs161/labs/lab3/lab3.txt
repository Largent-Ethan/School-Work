Password Generator Design:
	Set run as true and put the rest of main in while run is true
	Have all of the inputs in a while loop
	Check inputs using if statements and set valid to false, print an error, and break when its a bad input
	If all of the checks made with if pass then set valid to true and break
	If valid is true after inputs then run the password generator with thier given inputs
		The generator will loop for the length of the password
		Use ifs to check what character options are available
		Randomly find a number in range of the character options
		Randomly find a number in ascii range of that character option and print it without ending the line
	At the end ask if they would like to type another password in which you set run as true

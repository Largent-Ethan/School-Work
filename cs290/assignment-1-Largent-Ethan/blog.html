            <h4>April 11 2022</h4>
            <p>This assignment was a fun assignment that came pretty easily. I did have 
                trouble fixing a problem where both of the navbar elements would highlight 
                whenever I hovered over one of them, but I fixed it by putting them into 
                their own classes. Also, I spent most of my time trying to come up with a 
                color pallete that didn't look god awful. I think I knew how to do 
                most of this assignment at one point and forgot, but now I got it refreshed 
                in my head. I haven't ever published to the web before so that will be 
                something new to figure out. I used the lecture notes to do most of the 
                assignment and looked up how to do a couple specific things on Google.</p>

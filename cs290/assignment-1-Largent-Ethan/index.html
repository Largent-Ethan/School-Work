            <h4>Experience Prior to Class</h4>
            <p>Before taking this class I took a web development class in high school. 
                We went over basic html, css, and design. We didn't use javascript, 
                Node.js, or servers. I made a mock website for a bakery and a non-functional 
                pokemon card selling website. They are now on a thumbdrive locked in a box 
                and burried in my backyard never to be seen again, as it should be.</p>
            <h4>Desired Outcomes of Class</h4>
            <p>I hope to learn more about how to properly design a website, 
                the syntax and tools used in a professional website, javascript, 
                and how to make a good functional website</p>
            <h4>Campuswire Status</h4>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <h4>Interesting Fact</h4>
            <p>My nickname in highschool was Teeth. My group of friends had 2 Ethans in it so 
                people called us tall Ethan and short Ethan. People decided to combine the 
                two words into Teethan and Shethan accordingly. Not long later they thought 
                shortening it to Teeth was funnier.</p>
